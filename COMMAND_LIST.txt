-- Console Commands; no need for a prefix here

autocatcher or ac - Toggles autocatcher
identifier or i - Toggles Identifier
print_var_states or pvs - Prints variable states
spammer or s; If []set has been run in the current session -> Toggle text spammer

-> Anything typed through console that is NOT in the command list will echo through the bot if []set had been used; Better way to run commands on the bots behalf.
